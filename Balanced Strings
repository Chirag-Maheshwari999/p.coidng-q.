Two Strings are said to be balanced if all the characters present in the first string are also present in the second string.Position of characters does not matter. Write a code which takes two strings as input and prints True if they are balanced, and False otherwise.
Input format:
The first line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces, representing the first string 'str1'

The second line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces, representing the second string 'str2'.
Output Format:
 The only line of output prints either 'True' or 'False', denoting whether the two strings are balanced or not.
Sample Input 1

Sample Output 1
True
Sample Input 2

helmet
Sample Output 2
False

def balancedstrings(string1, string2):
    for i in string1:
        if i in string2:
            continue
        else:
            return "False"
    return "True"
  



str1 = input().strip()
str2 = input().strip()
print(balancedstrings(str1, str2))
